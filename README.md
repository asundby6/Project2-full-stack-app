# Project2-full-stack-app

Overview 

The "---" app is a useful way to find a more particular type of song, which doesnt relate to the genere. It is fortunate that there is a big name competitor that is most likely the only app that people know of for figuring out the name of a song. The competitor is called Shazam, which is the most, if not only in some cases, app used to find a song's name while it is playing. If you remember a life without the app, then you can understand the fruststration that comes with only knowing that one line of a forgotton song. My search filters will be the song lyrics that you managed to remember, and an optional added search parameter in which is the song's artist.
